comment { 
The goal is to have a evolving wallpapper for our gnome desktop

works with a crontab that goes with it :
in shell type: $>  contrab -e 
then:  
5 */3 * * * rebol -q -s /usr/local/bin/wallp.r
or for hourly check
5 * * * * rebol -q -s /usr/local/bin/wallp.r
then verify the crontab is installed with
crontab -l 
of course you should adapt path in crontab and in the second call line
to reflect your hown storage for this file and the dowloaded wallpapper
I recommand you to add rebol -q -s /usr/local/bin/wallp.r in a launcher on your desktop. 
and to add this line  in the startup applications.
