REBOL [
	Title: "Enumerated Type"
	Purpose: "Safe Enumerated Type for REBOL"
	Description: { These functions allow you to detect at runtime when
	you have tried to assign a value to a variable which is known to be
	an illegal possibility.  It determines this by checking against 
	a list you provide when the variable is declared.  There is also
	a "safe" variation of switch which ensures you have provided a
	case for all legal possibilities in the set.

	Script includes a regression test that you should enable after making
	changes to the implementation (to ensure nothing breaks).

	; Header conventions: http://www.rebol.org/one-click-submission-help.r
	Type: function
	Level: intermediate
	
	Usage: { To declare a new enum type & initialize its 
	possibilities, use make-enum-type:

		fruit: make-enum-type [apple orange banana mango]

	To create an instance of the enum, use make-enum:

		favorite_fruit: make-enum fruit 'apple

	To set its value, use the set-enum function:
  
		set-enum favorite_fruit 'banana ; works
		set-enum favorite_fruit 'shoe ; throws error
  
	To get its value, use the get-enum accessor:
 
		print get-enum favorite_fruit

	There's a special switch function you can use on enums which
	does some nifty added checking.  If you don't supply a /default
	branch, it will ensure there is a case for every legal value
	and no illegal values are present (though the cases can be 
	in any order):
 
		switch-enum favorite_fruit [
			mango [print "mango"]
			apple [print "apple"]
			banana [print "banana"]
			orange [print "orange"]
		] ; works

		switch-enum favorite_fruit [
			orange [print "orange"]
			mango [print "mango"]
			apple [print "apple"]
		] ; throws error

		switch-enum favorite_fruit [
			mango [print "mango"]
			apple [print "apple"]
			banana [print "banana"]
			orange [print "orange"]
			shoe [print "shoe"]
		] ; throws error

	If you use the /default refinement, then you can provide fewer
	than the entire set of cases.  It will still make sure that all 
	the possibilities you provide are valid:

		switch-enum/default favorite_fruit [
			mango [print "mango"]
			apple [print "apple"]
		] [print "orange or banana"] ; works

		switch-enum/default favorite_fruit [
			mango [print "mango"]
			apple [print "apple"]
			shoe [print "shoe"]
		] [print "orange or banana"] ; throws error

	There's an added protection ensuring that you have more than one
	missing case from the set which would run in the default:

		switch-enum/default favorite_fruit [
			mango [print "mango"]
			apple [print "apple"]
			banana [print "banana"]
			orange [print "orange"]
		] [print "would never run"] ; throws error

		switch-enum/default favorite_fruit [
			mango [print "mango"]
			apple [print "apple"]
			banana [print "banana"]
		] [print "explicit orange is clearer"] ; throws error

	If you don't want this kind of safety and enforced clarity, then 
	you are probably designing something which is anticipating future
	expansion.  Adding a couple of extra states will make this 
	intention explicit, and ensure all code paths are providing
	a default branch:

		fruit: make-enum-type [apple orange banana mango RESERVED1 RESERVED2]

	Unsafe switches are not advised, but can be achieved using the 
	ordinary switch:

		switch/default get-enum favorite_fruit [
			apple [print "apple"]
			bananana [print "banana"]	
		] [
			print "Doing mango/orange stuff..."
			print "...and mysterious errors happen..."
			print "...because we accidentally typed banana wrong!!!"
		] ; no error thrown

	}

	History: [
		0.1.0 [31-Mar-2007 {Initial version created with help 
		and suggestions from the AltME user community.  Not released to
		general public.} "Fork"]

		0.1.1 [12-Jun-2009 {Found on old drive of miscellaneous projects.
		Completed an unfinished conversion from "e/set_value v" style of
		calls to "set_enum e v" (better performance).  Custom error types.
		Implemented the default refinement.  Modified for REBOL.org header
		conventions and uploaded to REBOL.org } "Fork"]
