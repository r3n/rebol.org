    purpose: {
        I like to distribute certain scripts in compressed format.  They're smaller
        when compressed, and the compressed syntax keeps casual peeping Toms
        from messing with the code.  Maintaining scripts with compressed code can
        be a pain, though - decompress the compressed code with REBOL, copy,
        paste and edit, then recompress, copy, paste, and save.  This little script
        makes the process of creating and editing compressed scripts simple and
        fast.
