    Author:  Nick Antonaccio
    Purpose: {
        A quick and dirty way to print out help for all built in functions.
        Also includes a complete list of VID styles ("view layout" GUI
        widgets), VID layout words, and VID facets (standard properties
        available for all the VID styles).  Give it a minute to run...
        Taken from the tutorial at http://musiclessonz.com/rebol.html
