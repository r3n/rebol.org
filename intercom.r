    author:  Nick Antonaccio
    purpose: {
        A walkie-talkie push-to-talk type of VOIP application.  Extremely simple -
        just records sound from mic to .wav file, then transfers the wave file to
        another IP (where the same program is running), for playback.  Sender
        and receiver open in separate processes, and both run in forever loops
        to enable continuous communication back and forth.  (Can be run hands
        free by removing the the two "Ask" lines and uncommenting the "wait 2"
        comment, in the second forever loop).

Just for fun, here's an ultra compact obfuscated version.  It features port
error handling, automatic localhost testing (just press [ENTER] to use
localhost as the IP address), hands-free operation, audio data compression
before send and decompress on receive, and automatic minimum volume
testing (squelch - data not sent unless a given volume is detected, to save
bandwidth).  It can be pasted directly into the REBOL console, or saved to
a file and run.  The file size is 667 bytes!
