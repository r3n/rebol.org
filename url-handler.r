REBOL [
  Title: "URL Handler"
  File: %url-handler.r
  Author: [ "HY" ]
  Purpose: { A script to handle URLs as objects. Rebol's built-in 'decode-url function
             returns an object, but no methods to manipulate it. This script includes
             functions that make it possible to manipulate the URL as you please.

             CGI parameters are parsed into an alphabetized block for ease of comparison
             of URLs.
           }
  Date: 16-Aug-2003
  History: [
             03-Jan-2006 {Added /from-path-only refinement to 'as-string.}
             20-Apr-2005 {Trying make error! instead of throw...}
             04-Nov-2004 {Bug removed from alphabetization of CGI parameters.}
             28-Oct-2004 {Yet another bug removed in Carl's CGI parsing (colon related).}
             27-Oct-2004 {Added comparison function. For some reason, simple '= comparison didn't
                          function correctly.}
             26-Oct-2004 {Added CGI parameter parsing.}
             16-Oct-2004 {Removed a bug that caused absolute URLs starting with other protocols than
                          http and ftp to be parsed as relative URLs. The URL-handler now accepts
                          other protocols again. It is reasonable to accept all protocols, but as I
                          use only free rebol versions, I have no https protocol, and so I have to
                          check this elsewhere.}
             25-Sep-2004 "Added the library header"
             04-May-2004 {Removed a bug that caused CGI parameters to be lost from the string used
                          to construct the object. This bug found its way in on one of the two
                          previous updates.}
             22-Mar-2004 {Removed a bug that caused a crash when a URL ended with
                          no trailing slash after the host name, but a line break instead.}
             26-Mar-2004 {Now accepts only ftp:// and http:// protocols. Also fixed a bug that would cause
                          "http://some/redirect?http://www.url.com/" to be parsed erroneously.}
             22-Mar-2004 "Added protocols that we don't wish to support"
             19-Mar-2004 "Added a few examples and forbid relative URLs with no protcol and/or host"
             13-Jan-2004 "Fixed a bug in handling of relative (section) links"
             16-Aug-2003 "Seems this is the date I first made the script."
