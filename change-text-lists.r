    Title: "Scripts To Change The Appearance Of Text-Lists"
    Date: 08-Mar-2008
    Version: 1.0.0
    File: %change-text-lists.r
    Author: "R.v.d.Zee"
    Owner: "R.v.d.Zee"
    Rights: "Copyright (C) R. v.d.Zee 2008 All Rights Reserved"

    Purpose: {This script is a tool that provides script writers with script that can be used to
             change the appearance of text-lists.}

    Usage: {Enter the name of your text-list in the field and select an attribute to modify.  Copy the
            displayed script with the Ctrl & C keys, and paste into your script. Some editing may be
            necessary.}

    Notes: {More changes and methods could be added to the list, and similar scripts could be written
           for other GUI objects, the scroller for example.            

           Most of the scripts included below can be found with the REBOL help command.  The change of
           color of the Highlight Bar is from an original script written in French, I have lost the
           author's name - apologies!.}

"Add Data" {Each line of the text-list has 5 strings of data.  The strings run together because none of the 20 lines of text are formatted. The scroller dragger size is unchanged and it does not scroll the list.

The scrollers work, like the one to the right, if the length of the text-list data is equal to or greater than the number of lines of the list - when the layout was viewed.}

"Order Data - Default Tabs 40" {A tab with the default value of 40 pixels is appended to to each string of the series of 5 strings of each line.

Columns appear, but they are not evenly aligned.}

"Order Data - Set Tabs 80" {The value of the tabs are increased to 80, but not all of the columns have aligned.

The data is from the Australian Postal Codes.}

"Order Data - Set Tabs 220" {Eventually, when the tabs are about 220 across, an evenly spaced list is formed, but most of the columns appear to be quite far apart.}

"Order Data - Script" {The lines can also be formatted by:
- first changing to a font with fixed width characters,
- then finding the longest string in each column 
- increasing the length of all the shorter strings in a column
- appending all strings with a tab
}

"Set Dragger" {If no data is associated the with text-list, or if the length of the data is less than the line count,  the dragger appears to be unresponsive, even when new and longer data is later added.  

Initially assigning an array with at least as many elements as the line count will also activate the dragger.
}

"Color Top Clicker (down)" {The top clicker turns orange when clicked.  The arrow remains orange.}       

"Large Line Height" {If the font size is increased, the line height may need to be increased as well.  Increasing the line height allows the text to wrap within the line, an undesired effect in this case.}

"No Scroller" {A short list needs no scroller.  The red edge reveals that more script could be written....}

"Adjust Height" {A little untidy, the bottom line of the list was cut off. The script to change this is included, but just writing the script with the size  700x305 instead of 700x300 would do.}

"Red Track Edge" {All of the scroller component edges can be modified.  Providing an edge and color to the track can be done with   "Red Track Edge" [
        example/pane/pane/2/edge/size: 1x0
        example/pane/pane/2/edge/effect: none 
        example/pane/pane/2/edge/color: red
    ]
but...not included - all of the tracks & facets in the layouts are changed in this script.}

"Number Lines" {Numbering the lines can be useful, and can ensure that each line of the list is unique.  If two or more identical lines exist, highlighting one of them will cause all of the identical lines to be highlighted. Sequentially numbered lines are not identical, only one line can be hilighted.}

"Highlight Bar Color" {The new color is blue, the default color is a light yellow.}

"Image Background" {Downloading image from www.rebol.com

The highlight bar in the small text-list appears before the image has downloaded - but only because the line "show changer" was written before the download instruction. Otherwise, the highlight would not appear until after the image has downloaded. The delayed feedback can be ambiguous.}

"Pattern Background" {The background patterns of the script are generated by the Patterns script of the Rebol tool scripts, in the Rebol folder from the Rebol Viewtop.}

"Fit Image" {If no image appears, it must first be downloaded.  Click "Image Background"

If not connected to the internet, the in-built REBOL logo image, logo.gif,  will be loaded instead of the ocean  photo.}

"Arial Font" {Arial Font is not a fixed width font, so the column alignment has changed.}

"Notes" {Some scripts can be copied and pasted below the layout that contains the text-list. Others, however, like "Select Line 10", "De-select" or "Set Dragger" would not be written outside the layout.}
