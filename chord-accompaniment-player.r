			This program plays chord progressions.  Simply type in
			the names of the chords that you'd like played, with a
			space between each chord.  For silence, use the
			underscore ("_") character.  Set the tempo by entering a 
			delay time (in fractions of second) to be paused between
			each chord.  Click the start button to play from the 
			beginning, and the stop button to end.  Pressing start
			again always begins at the first chord in the 
			progression.  The save and load buttons allow you to 
			store to the hard drive any songs you've created.
			Chord types allowed are major triad (no chord symbol - 
			just a root note), minor triad ("m"), dominant 7th 
			("7"), major 7th ("maj7"), minor 7th ("m7"), diminished
			7th ("dim7"), and half diminished 7th ("m7b5").
			*** ALL ROOT NOTES ARE LABELED WITH FLATS (NO SHARPS)
			F# = Gb, C# = Db, etc...
