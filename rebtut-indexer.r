	Title: "A keyword based search engine for the Rebtutorial articles index page" 
	Purpose: {Was tired looking up visually the index page for any article containing a specific keyword.
			  
			  For now the script loads and parses the original articles' index page duirectly from the Rebtutorial.com web site, 
			  splitting URL links apart from their descriptions, and while counting them it appends them to a block 
			  that can be searched by keyword. 
			  
			  Every occurence is itself appended into a list that displays itself when the verbose mode is set to 'true. 
			  
			  Furthermore, for the time being, you'll have to manually delete the many comments included here
			  for documentation and exploration of another auto-doc selective help system, inspired by the comments section of
			  the dynamic dictionary (%word-browser.r script) found in the RebWorld - Tools folder.
			  
			  See the EXAMPLES section for more info and the look I originally plan to have.
			  Every suggestion is welcome and appreciated. Eventually I would prefer to develop a RSpec like product
			  for keeping executables specs in sync with Unit tests (%rUnit.r) of the xUnit family.

Notes:
 
Patterns found from the analysis of the "Rebtutorial Articles index"       (http://reboltutorial.com/articles/)
====================================================================

0- The articles section delimiting pattern	(used to delimit and isolate only the articles from the entire page)
------------------------------------------

<div class="azindex">					; This is the mark that precedes all the articles' links-descriptions
...										;   <--- Articles are placed here
<div style="clear:both;">				; This the mark that follows all the articles'


1- The section-name href="#" pattern	(used to identify the section names preceding each group of links)
------------------------------------
<li><h2><a href="#">       				; part preceding the char ([) or the letter (A-Z) identifying each section 
					 "<"			    ; part following this char or letter 
				    ^					; position of the char or letter to grab during the parsing process
				    |                   ;   (one of  [, A, B, C, ... , Z )
				    v
<li><h2><a href="#">[</a></h2></li>   	; 1st section - the section appearing before the one for the letter A
<li><h2><a href="#">A</a></h2></li>   	; 2nd section (Letter A)
<li><h2><a href="#">B</a></h2></li>   	; 3rd section (Letter B)

...									  	; Not every section has to be present


2- The URL link "href=" pattern    		(used to detect each link-description in a group of URLs)
-------------------------------
"<li><a href="							; part preceding each URL link 
					       ">"		  	; part ending each URL link 
			    ^						; position of the URL to grab during the parsing process
				|   	                   
				v
"<li><a href="http://...   ">"			; Every link has the form http://...
										; and is followed on the next line by this <span class="head"> tag


3- The URL desc <span...> pattern    	(used to detect each link-description in a group of URLs)
----------------------------------

<span class="head">						; part preceding the description part of each URL link
										; The positioning is implemented using 2 subcommands "<span class=" and [7 skip]
					 	   "<"			; part ending each URL link description
					 ^
					 |
					 v
<span class="head">Why ... </span></a></li> ; Example of a real link description
