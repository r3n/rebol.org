    Title: "Closure"

    Author: "Ladislav Mecir"
    Purpose: {
        CLOSURE is suggested instead of FUNC when you need functions
		exhibiting async behaviour,	e.g. for:
		- View
		- Async Ports
		- Higher Order Functions
		
		Closures differ from "normal" Rebol functions by using a fresh
		context every time they are called.
		
		Rule of thumb: if your function is returning a new function, block, or
		a local word, you will be safe if it is a closure.
