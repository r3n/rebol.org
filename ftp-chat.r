    title: "FTP Chat Room"
    date: 29-june-2008
    file: %ftp-chat.r
    purpose: {
        A simple chat application that lets users send instant text messages
        back and forth across the Internet.
        The chat "rooms" are created by dynamically creating, reading, 
        appending, and saving text files via ftp (to use the program, you'll
        need access to an available ftp server: ftp address, username, and
        password).
