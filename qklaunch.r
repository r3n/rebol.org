  title:       "QkLaunch - Quick Program Launcher"
  author:      "Arie van Wingerden"
  purpose:     "Easily launch programs from folder structure acting as a menu."
  description: {To appreciate this program, setup a folder (directory) structure
                which resembles the menu structure you like to have.
                Now, change the variable *basedir to the top-level folder
                of that structure.
                When you execute this program, you can navigate through the
                structure and open any folder and start any program within
                that structure.}
