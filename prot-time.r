    author: "Pavel"
    Date: 30-Dec-2010
    Purpose: "R3 read time from RFC868 time server"
    Note: "Based on Graham's example datetime scheme for R3"
    Description: {
        create Rebol3 time:// scheme, 
        read time://time.server returns number of UTC seconds from 1-jan-1900,
        read/lines time://time.server returns well formated local time
        }
    ToDo: {- working with state should enable a port use
           - remove ugly /line refinement possibly thru write block actor}
