This is a simple application used to demonstrate the fundamentals of the liquid dataflow module.
	
USAGE:
------
All of the character abilities are bound to the value 1 to 25.  There is no way you can cause them to go out of bounds.

By clicking on the little +/- besides them, you can nudge the related ability as long as you follow the rules.  Either the limit of 25 is reached, or you have gone beyond the Maximum number of points allowed for the character.

The + will actually disactivate themselves whenever to break or meet the limits allowed for the abilities.

The fields do allow you to go beyond the max points, this is to allow you freedom in editing the values, knowing that you will lower another ability afterwards.

The total of all abilities is always kept up to date, it will even tell you how much points you have left or by how much you have gone beyond the max points limit.

The Max points is also linked in real time to all the values, so that if you lower or raise it, all the dependencies will automatically reflect the change instantly.

NOTES:
------
The data binding is NOT BUILT WITHIN THE INTERFACE, its the DATA WHICH IS SELF-BOUND, and the interface will always react to the data, since they are linked or piped together. Try typing something other than a number.

VERBOSITY:
---------
You can switch application and liquid verbosity in real-time thanks to the built-in capabilities of the slim library manager, called vprint.  There is also a subset of the featurebase included in a simple 'DOable module on rebol.org, named vprint.r .

NEXT RELEASE:
------------
I will build another version of the tool which adds skills selection and editing.  The skills will be related to the abilities and will reflect any change in ability in real-time.
