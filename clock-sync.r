    title: "Windows clock sync"
    date: 28-feb-2009
    file: %clock-sync.r
    purpose: {
        Synchronize your Windows date and time with the clock on your
        web server.   The 4 line CGI script given at the end of this example
        prints out the current date and time on your web server, and this
        script reads it and sets the operating system clock to match it.
        (To do the same thing in Linux, see Ladislav Mecir's "set-system-time-lin"
        function at http://www.fm.tul.cz/~ladislav/rebol/nistclock.r).
