    purpose: {
        Converts number values to their spoken English equivalent.
        (i.e., 23482194 = "Twenty Three million, Four Hundred Eighty
        Two thousand, One Hundred Ninety Four").  This code was
        created for a check writing application, but is perhaps
        useful elsewhere.  The algorithm was partially derived from
        the article at http://www.blackwasp.co.uk/NumberToWords.aspx
        (C# code).
