	Title: "Use-rule"
	File: %use-rule.r
	Author: {"Ladislav Mecir" "Gregg Irwin"}

	Purpose: {
		Create a recursion and thread-safe parse rule with local variables.
		R2/R3 compatible.
	}
	Notes: {
		The USE-RULE function implements two USE variants as described in
		http://www.rebol.net/wiki/Parse_Project.

		The default, rebinding variant, rebinds the given rule every time
		it is used for matching (that is why we call it "rebinding variant"),
		while the /no-rebind variant binds the given rule just once.

		The difference between the rebinding and the /no-rebind variant
		is similar as the difference between closures and functions.

		The WORDS block is expected to contain only words.

		The /no-rebind variant expects the WORDS block
		to not contain the word 'local, but the word 'local
		is handled as one of the use words.
		
		The /no-rebind variant expects the WORDS block to not contain
		the word 'inner-body, which is not handled as one of the use words.

		The implementation of the USE-RULE function does not use
		the latest parse enhancements to remain compatible with R2
		as well as with R3.
