    Purpose: { Downloads all the "Picture Of The Day" images (current and past)
	from the National Geographic website and saves it to a location of your choice.
	Revisions: 
	Version 1.2.4 Changed from "Viewing" the POTD to "Browsing" the POTD which then
		allows the user to go back to see other pictures that may have been missed.
	Version 1.2.3 Added displays for current file name download. Added slider to set
		the number of downloads for this run.
	Version 1.2.2 Added a stop (abort) button.
	Version 1.2.1 I didn't like the silent operation so I added a progress meter.
	Version 1.2.0 Modified to download all past POD (pictures of the day) images starting
	from 2001-04-21 to current date. Also modified to store each POD with a unique
	filename and also download the description of the picture and save it as an HTML file
	with links to Next and Previous pictures. Updated the help files and their display
	using the Request/OK function instead of the dump to console.  Added a directory
	requester for storing of files so users don't have to modify the code.  Added a 
	preferences file for storing this information as well as the maximum number of
	pictures per day to download.

	This version still uses the original NG website as it still works okay.  I have
	been able to download all images from 2001-04-21 to today, 2006-06-09.
	It will only download images which exist on the server but don't exist on your
	local drive in the path specified.  I put a 100 at a time limiter on the program
	because it seems that National Geographic has processes in place to limit
	the number of downloads or connections (possibly Denial Of Service attack
	blockers), because it seemed to hang when trying to download all of them at once.
	I tried again a few hours later and was able to download another 100.
	
	Like the version 1.0.0 it will download the large backdrop but it now gets the
	description from the original photo of the day page.
	
	It will display the current picture of the day and wait for the window to close
	before downloading the rest of the images.
	
	Version 1.1.0 by Charles Mougel: Used a different URL
	
	Version 1.0.0 by Ian Munroe: Downloads a single picture of the day - must be run 
	everyday.

	The argument "-p" causes a "print to console".
	These directions can be seen by adding a "-h" agrument.}

HelpString1: {This program downloads all the current picture of the days from 
	NationalGeographic.com and saves them to a location of your choice.
	You can run this program at any time because it will only download
	images which exist on the server but don't already exist on your local
	drive in the path specified.  Therefore, there are no worries about
	downloading the same picture twice and wasting time and bandwidth.  It
	will download the backdrop from the large wallpaper page, but gets the
	description for the HTML page that is created for each picture from
	the original photo of the day page.  ... Continue?}

HelpString2: {This program will display the current picture of the day, (if not already
	downloaded), while downloading the rest of the images.  The program will
	download about 100 images and this can be changed by using the slider or adjusting
	the second field in the NationalGeographicDownloadPrefs.txt file.  If it has
	difficulty connecting or downloading the program will just stop.  If this happens
	try the program again at a different time of day as the NatGeo site may be too
	busy. ... Continue?}

PrefsHelpString1: {The first time this is run it will prompt you for a location to store
	the images and html files.  It saves this in a prefs file so it won't
	ask you again. ... Continue?}

PrefsHelpString2: {The directory requester that comes up may not be familar to most
	users but is easy to learn.  Use the orange up arrow near the top right to
	move up a directory level and click on a directory name to display that directory's
	contents.  Once you are at the directory that you want to save the images and
	html files (today and other days) click the "Open". ...Continue?}

PrefsHelpString3: {A "Rebol - Security Check" window may open where you confirm that you
	want to browse your computer to find the directory to store the images.  Because
	you know that you have run this program (and not some unauthorized user) select
	"Allow all". ... Continue?}
