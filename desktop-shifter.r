   Name: [{Daniel Sirotzke} {Izkata}]
   Version: 1.0
   Date: 2-Feb-2008
   Title: "Desktop Shifter"
   Notes: {
      Please note that this script uses 'call with the terminal command gconftool-2, so
      I'm fairly certain this script will only work under Gnome on Linux.

      This was also an experiment of mine in putting the daemon, client, and datafile all
      in a single file, as well as using the datafile to store the port number - just in case
      another program was using it, so that the client knows where to connect to.

      To start the daemon, "Serve" must be used as an argument:
      Command Line/Run Command:
         $  ./rebol desktop-shifter.r Serve
      From Rebol:
         >> do/args %desktop-shifter.r {Serve}

      Also, the Client will throw a script error if the daemon is not running on the port last
      saved in the datafile.
   }
   Warnings: {
      Because of save/load working the way they do, all comments vanish from the file after
      every use!  That's why I'm using 'Comment instead of semicolons for comments!

      The Data block must always be the second thing in the file, this header being the first.

      If you want a #!/path/to/rebol line at the beginning, you'll have to add it yourself.  There's
      a comment that tells you where to add it - I've left mine there as an example.
   }
   Purpose: {
      To change the desktop wallpaper at specified intervals.

      There's a modifiable default time that a wallpaper will stay before switching.
      Each wallpaper has separate settings for:
         *Stretched versus Centered
         *Solid color versus Top/Bottom Gradient versus Left/Right gradient background
         *The two colors that can be chosen
         *A box for the time the wallpaper stays up before shifting - it says "Default" if it's
            using the default setting

   The above block is the datafile.  The following two functions save and load from it:

Comment {
   If any of my functions drive you insane, I'm fairly certain it would be this one...

   It's dynamically generating the list that's displayed to you when modifying the settings.
   Every time you change anything, the data is saved and the screen re-generated.
