    Usage:   {
        The url scheme defined in RFC2229 is:

        dict://<user>;<auth>@<host>:<port>/d:<word>:<database>
        dict://<user>;<auth>@<host>:<port>/m:<word>:<database>:<strat>

        For instance:

            read dict://dict.org/d:rebel

        returns definitions of "rebel" or:

            read dict://dict.org/m:reb

        returns words that may match "reb", in the same manner as a
        spell-checker. Other strategies can be specified. See the RFC
        for details, or use strat: as the query type for a list.

            read dict://dict.org/

        returns the available databases.

        This port handler will also accept urls of this form:

            read dict://dict.org/word

        which will return definitions for the word in question.

        Some port handler "extensions" from the RFC
        This handler is coded to return a block! of string!
           or a block! of blocks for definitions

        Also:
            default host is set to all.dict.org, See http://www.dict.org
            read dict:///d:word or
            read dict:///define:word for definitions
            read dict:///m:word or
            read dict:///match:word for matches and translations
            read dict:///help: will return a block of help
            read dict:///strat: will return the strategies for all.dict.org
            read dict:///info:db for database source and copyright info
            read dict:///server: system administrator server information
            read dict:///status: server status and timings
        without the colon, they are just words for definition

        Demo: To try out the samples, instead of just do %dict-scheme.r
           Use dict: do %dict-scheme.r  as the information hiding context
           is returned by do.  Then you can evaluate dict/demo

comment {
This code is based on the work of Jeff Kreis,
held at ftp://ftp.dict.org/pub/dict/contrib/dict.rebol
Jeff has coded his handler for direct port access, didn't
work properly under 2.7.5.4.2
